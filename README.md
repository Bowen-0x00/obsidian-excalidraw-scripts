# Obsidian-Excalidraw-Scripts

[English](./README.md) | [简体中文](docs/README_ZH.md)

This is my personal repository of [obsidian-excalidraw-plugin](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin) custom scripts.

It implements many useful/interesting features to enhance the experience of using Excalidraw.

Some scripts rely on [modified version](https://github.com/Bowen-0x00/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin-ymjr) to Obsidian-Excalidraw, while others don't require any dependencies.

You can find the demo obsidian vault at [obsidian-excalidraw-example-vault](https://github.com/Bowen-0x00/obsidian-excalidraw-example-vault), that includes the modified plugin and many custom scripts. You can directly open it with Obsidian and experience the features. Here is a demonstration [video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1zN4y1H7Dx/).
