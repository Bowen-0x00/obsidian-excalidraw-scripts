# Obsidian-Excalidraw-Scripts

[English](./README.md) | [简体中文](docs/README_ZH.md)

This is my personal repository of [obsidian-excalidraw-plugin](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin) custom scripts.

It implements many useful/interesting features to enhance the experience of using Excalidraw.

Some scripts rely on [modified version](https://github.com/Bowen-0x00/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin-ymjr) to Obsidian-Excalidraw, while others don't require any dependencies.
